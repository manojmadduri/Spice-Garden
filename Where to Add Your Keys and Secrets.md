I have created the `razorpay-demo.html` file. Now, here is the explanation of where to add your secret keys to make the integration work in the main application.

### Where to Add Your Keys and Secrets

There are two places where you need to add your secret keys:

1. __Client-Side (React App):__ Your public Razorpay Key ID needs to be added to your application's environment variables.
2. __Server-Side (Supabase Edge Function):__ Your Razorpay Key ID, Razorpay Key Secret, and Supabase credentials need to be added as secrets to your Supabase Edge Function.

### 1. Client-Side Configuration (`.env` file)

You need to add your __public Razorpay Key ID__ to a `.env` file in the root of your project. This key is safe to expose on the client-side and is used to initialize the Razorpay checkout.

__Instructions:__

1. If you don't already have a `.env` file, create one in the root of your project.

2. Open the `.env.example` file to see the required format.

3. Add the following line to your `.env` file, replacing `YOUR_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID` with your actual key:

   ```javascript
   VITE_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=YOUR_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID
   ```

### 2. Server-Side Configuration (Supabase Secrets)

For security reasons, your __secret keys__ must be stored securely on the server-side. In this project, you will add them as secrets to your `create-razorpay-order` Supabase Edge Function.

__Instructions:__

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard.

2. Navigate to __Edge Functions__ and select the `create-razorpay-order` function.

3. Go to the __Secrets__ settings for that function.

4. Add the following four secrets one by one:

   - __`RAZORPAY_KEY_ID`__: Your public Razorpay Key ID.
   - __`RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET`__: Your secret Razorpay Key.
   - __`SUPABASE_URL`__: Your project's Supabase URL.
   - __`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`__: Your Supabase `service_role` key.

By following these instructions, you will have securely configured both the client and server sides of the application to work with Razorpay.

I have now provided the Razorpay demo and the instructions for adding the secret keys.
